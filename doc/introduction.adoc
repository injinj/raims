Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Rai MS is a Link State based protocol for the construction of Publish/Subscribe
messaging systems, which allows for loops and redundancies in network
connections between peers and supports PGM (Pragmatic General Multicast) based
multicast along with TCP point-to-point style internetworking.  Here are the
main features:

1. **Link State Protocol**: This is a type of network protocol used to manage
how nodes (or routers) share information. In a Link State protocol, each node
has a map of the network and calculates the best path for data to travel. This
method is beneficial for efficiently managing Pub/Sub systems, where messages
need to be distributed effectively.  Among the advantages of Link State
protocols over other routing methods are fast convergence, efficient routing,
and load balancing.

2. **Pub/Sub Messaging**: In Pub/Sub systems, publishers send messages without
specifying the receivers. Subscribers express interest in certain types of
messages and receive only those. This model is widely used in real-time data
distribution and event-driven architectures.

3. **Inbox Point to Point**: Each subscriber can have an Inbox subject
associated with it to allow messaging between two endpoints and for optimizing
the delivery path.

4. **Loops and Redundancies**: The protocol's ability to handle loops and
redundancies is crucial. In networking, loops can cause problems like repeated
data transmission. However, in certain designs, controlled loops and
redundancies can provide alternative paths for data, enhancing reliability and
avoiding single points of failure.

5. **PGM Based Multicast**: PGM is a reliable multicast transport protocol. In
multicast, data is sent from one source to multiple destinations
simultaneously. PGM ensures that all intended recipients in a multicast group
receive the data, which is ideal for applications where data delivery is
critical.

6. **TCP Point-to-Point Internetworking**: TCP can be used for setting up a
direct and reliable link between two nodes in the network, providing a stable
channel for data exchange.  AES encryption is employed by default on TCP links
between peers.

7. **RV, NATS, and Redis Clients**: The client protocol is compatible with RV,
NATS Core, and Redis protocols.  These can interoperate, with transparent
binary and JSON message conversion between endpoints.

8. **Message Authentication**: All messages that flow between peers are
authenticated and can't be forged, corrupted, or replayed.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) key pair is generated for
a service and for each user that is pre-configured.  A ECDH (Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman) key pair is generated for by peer on startup for a key exchange
that establishes a 32 byte session key.  This session key is used to
authenticate messages sent and received using a MAC (Message Authentication
Code) to verify the source.  Each peer in the system has a unique session key
so that a message sent from any one of them can be authenticated.

This is described further in <<authentication>>.

Console Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The model that a node implements in the base client is close to that of a
router.  The command line resembles a cisco style interface with the ability to
bring up and down transports at run time, examine the state of them, ping other
nodes, traceroute, get help on commands with the '?' key, use command line
completion, telnet into the node.  More in <<console>>.

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^

A node consists of a router with several transports.  The term "transport" is
modeled as a switch, where other nodes on the transport are attached to switch
and one port of the switch is attached to the router.  All of the nodes plugged
into the switch can communicate without going through the router.  The
facilitates a multicast style transport, where a single multicast send reaches
multiple nodes within the switch.  It also allows an listener to accept
multiple local connections which use a protocol like RV, NATS, or Redis and do
communication without regard to the other nodes attached to other switches or
transports through the router.

The subscription mechanism has three layers:  the router, the switch, and the
connection.  The router uses bloom filters to route subjects, the switch uses
32 bit mac addresses based on the subject/wildcard hash, and the connection
uses a btree of subjects:

----
  router <-> bloom filter 1 <-> switch 1 <-> mac 1 <-> connection 1 <-> btree entry 1
             bloom filter 2     switch 2     mac 2     connection 2     btree entry 2
----

More about this in the <<network>> section.

Link-State Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first thing a node does after authentication, is download the peers LSDB
(Link-State DB), which first consists of records for every other peer:

----
  { bridge id, session key, peer name, sub seqno, link seqno, bloom }
----

The seqno values allow for delta updates of the LSDB, which can add/remove a
link or add/remove a subscription from the bloom filter.  The bloom filter
contains everything needed to filter the subscriptions that the peer has
interest.  It generally uses about 2 bytes per subscription for a false
positive error rate at about 0.05% (1 in 2000 subjects), so if a peer has a
10,000 subjects or wildcards open, it will be about 20,000 bytes in size.

Then for each bridge id, it downloads the links that the peer is connected
to for each transport/switch.  The local bridging that occurs for foreign
protocols like RV, NATS and Redis are directly attached to the peer and are
considered the peers subscriptions.  In other words, the bloom filter for a
peer has all of the subscriptions for every RV, NATS or Redis client
connected to it.

The link records are for nodes which are directly attached to the peer via
a transport.  There may be many nodes using the same link attached to the
peer and a node may be reachable via multiple transports.  The unique
feature identifying this link is the bridge id, tport id pair.

----
  { bridge id, tport name, peer name, tport id, cost, remote tport name, remote tport id }
----

A delta update of the LSDB, whether link change or subscription change is
broadcast to all of the nodes.  If an network split occurs and some nodes are
orphaned from the network for a period before rejoining, then synchronization
of the LSDB with a peer occurs when the sub seqno or the link seqno has
advanced.  Any peer is capable of updating any other peer since the LSDB is the
same in every one.  The primary means of watching the seqno changes is with a
transport heartbeat sent on a 10 second (default) interval between directly
connected peers.  In addition, each peer randomly chooses another peer to ping
at a random interval based on the heartbeat interval.

The behavior of a transport which becomes too congested is that the heartbeat
misses and the link is dropped and rejoined at the next heartbeat.  The effect
of this is that 10 seconds of traffic is rerouted or lost if there are no other
routes to the peers on the other side.

More in the <<linkstate>> section.

Multicast routing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any time a link is added to the LSDB, the routing is recalculated using a
Dijkstra path finding algorithm.  The shortest path is chosen, and if multiple
equal paths exist, then the link with the lowest weight is chosen.  Load
balancing can occur when there are two or more equal paths to a peer based on
the subject mac of the destination.  The LSDB is considered "consistent" when
all peers agree that a link exists.  If peer A has an outgoing link to peer B,
then peer B must have a link to peer A.  If this is not the case, then LSDB
synchronization requests to the closest peer along the path are performed until
the network converges to a consistent state.

All peers will choose the same route for a subject when the LSDB is
synchronized.  If the LSDB is not synchronized, then messages may be duplicated
to alternative routes or may decide that routing is not necessary for a message
when it is.  For this reason, keeping the LSDB synchronized as fast as possible
is a top priority of a node.

A technique called reverse path forwarding is used for multicast messages.  If
a destination unicast to a peer, which is the case for inbox style messaging,
then there is only one path for the message, the shortest path.  With
multicast, there are multiple paths that a message may take, each is the
shortest path to a subscriber.  Reverse path forwarding uses the source of the
message to route it.  The algorithm increments the distance from the source to
compute a set of nodes that are possible for a message at each hop, then
chooses the best traversal of the network graph so that the entire network is
covered with a minimal set of transmissions.  Once this is calculated, it can
be reused until a link in the LSDB is updated again.  This set of paths is
augmented with bloom filters from the peers, so that a router will forward a
message only if it passes through the reverse path forwarding algorithm and it
passes through the bloom filters attached to the path.

Wildcard Matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A generic PCRE based conversion is used to enable multiple wildcard styles to
coexist between peers.  The bloom filter contains both a prefix and suffix
matching filter, so that A.*.B is matched with both ends of the wildcard.  When
a subject is passed through a bloom filter the prefix of the subject is hashed
with different seeds based on the prefix lengths used.  If a peer is interested
in subject prefix lengths of 3, 5, 10, 20, as well as the subject itself, these
lengths are noted in the bloom filter and the hash set is calculated as

----
  hs = hash( subject, seed = 0 )
  h3 = hash( subject[1..3], seed = 3 )
  h5 = hash( subject[1..5], seed = 5 )
  h10 = hash( subject[1..10], seed = 10 )
  h20 = hash( subject[1..20], seed = 20 )
----

If any of these are hash values present in the bloom filter, then a check for
the suffix matches are done.  The hash set is computed in groups before any
routing based on the entire set of hashes needed is done in order to take
advantage of instruction parallelism, computing several hashes for each
iteration of the subject length.

Anycast and Shardcast
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An anycast route is a single match of many.  A set of peers interested in a
subject can be computed because the LSDB contains filters for all of them.
This set of peers interested can be randomly chosen and unicast routed to the
chosen peer.  If the peer has a false match, or the interest in the subject is
lost, then that peer can choose another from the set and forward it.

A shardcast is a set of peers interested in the prefix of a subject, but only a
shard of the subject space.  The bloom filter contains enough info to filter by
both the prefix hash and the subject space that a peer is interested in.  In
this case, the peers have predetermined how many shards there should be and how
the shards are split between them.  If A subscribes to X.* using shard 1/2 and
B subscribes to X.* using shard 2/2, then the subjects X.Y and X.Z is split
between A and B based on the hash of X.Y and the hash of X.Z.  This is a
variation of suffix matching where the hash of the subject is used to
discriminate the route of the message.

Why use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~

Distributed systems are more often crossing network boundaries.  Traditional
broker based systems or multicast based systems have difficulty expanding
beyond a these boundaries.  To remedy this, network designs may deploy
application specific routers, or they shard the messaging system, or they use
other protocols like mesh or gossip based systems.  All of these solutions have
advantages and drawbacks.

The aim of this system is to:

1. Flexible transports and networking.
2. Fast message authentication.
3. Fast network convergence.
4. Distribute messages only when interest is present.
5. Utilize redundant links.
6. Flexible message distribution:  inbox, multicast, anycast, shardcast.
7. Flexible wildcarding mechanism.
8. Ability to recover subscription interest at the endpoints.

Building
~~~~~~~~

There are a lot of submodules and dependencies, so at present, building using
the https://github.com/raitechnology/build[build] Makefile is the easiest way
to compile everything.  Clone it, install the dependencies, clone all of the
modules, build everything.  The rpm dependencies will probably need the
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/[EPEL repo] installed when using an
enterprise RedHat, CentOS, or derivative for the liblzf-devel package (and
maybe others).

----
  $ git clone https://github.com/raitechnology/build
  $ cd build
  $ make install_rpm_deps
  $ make clone
  $ make
----

If this completes, there will be a static binary at `raims/OS/bin/ms_server`
where OS is something like `RH8_x86_64`.

If you set the env var for debugging, then the `RH8_x86_64-g` directory will be
populated without optimization and with the -g flag.

----
  $ export port_extra=-g
  $ make
----

Running the MS server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first task is to create the authentication keys for a service "test".  The
`ms_gen_key` program creates and updates the configuration.  The user keys are
what stored in the `user_X_svc_test.yaml` files and contain ECDH key pairs.
The service is a ECDSA key pair and signs each user and stores the signatures
in the `svc_test.yaml` file.  The `startup.yaml` contains the startup config.
The `config.yaml` file includes all of the files in the config directory.

----
  $ cd build/raims
  $ ms_gen_key -u A B C -s test
  create dir  config                          -- the configure directory
  create file config/.salt                    -- generate new salt
  create file config/.pass                    -- generated a new password
  create file config/config.yaml              -- base include file
  create file config/param.yaml               -- parameters file
  create file config/svc_test.yaml            -- defines the service and signs u
  create file config/user_A_svc_test.yaml     -- defines the user
  create file config/user_B_svc_test.yaml     -- defines the user
  create file config/user_C_svc_test.yaml     -- defines the user
  OK? y
  done
----

This creates the keys for users A, B, and C.  These keys are encrypted with the
`.pass` and `.salt` files.

More about this in the [key config guide](keys.md).

Run the `ms_server` program and configure it.  The `-u` option specifies the
user and service.  The `-c` option starts the command line interface, where the
networks can be defined and connected.  This following defines a mesh endpoint
and saves it to the startup config.

----
  $ ms_server -u A.test -c

The files are described in the <<configuration>> section and the
transports are described in the <<network>> section.  The
authentication keys need to be distributed to all the nodes, but the networking
config will be somewhat unique to each node.
