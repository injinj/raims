Description of Transports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Rai MS transports function is to join all of the peers connected through a
node together in one virtual overlay network that provides basic pub/sub
multicast.

A transport has two primary roles, the routing of messages between peers and
the managing of protocol dependent subscription management and message framing.
The internal transports (PGM, TCP Mesh) all use the internal protocol semantics
for messaging.  The external bridged transports (RV, NATS, Redis) have
protocols with similarities, but they have unique behaviors that make them more
complicated that the internal transports.

The design of the internal transports allow them to be used by any of the
external transports, so RV can use a TCP mesh or PGM multicast or some of
combination of them interconnected.  Similar for NATS and Redis, they can also
use PGM multicast as well as a TCP mesh.  The routing of messages between peers
is agnostic to the type of protocol that the endpoint clients are using.  It is
possible to use the Rai MS protocol directly as well.  The `ms_server` console
contains the ability to publish, subscribe without using an external client.
The Telnet transport uses the console protocol.  The Web transport serves
builtin html pages that interface with the console protocol through websocket
protocol.

There are two sides to transport configuration, the listener and the connector.
Only the internal transports support the connecting side (PGM, mesh, TCP), the
client side (RV, NATS, Redis, Telnet, Web) only uses listeners and do not have
a cost.  The device option will auto-discover a connector or listener via
multicast through a device.  This requires that the connector and listener are
on the same broadcast domain or have multicast routing configured.

The config file format is a JSON or YAML with a record that can have these
fields:

----
  tport: <name>
  type: <pgm | mesh | tcp | rv | nats | redis | telnet | web | name>
  route:
    listen: <address>
    connect: <address>
    device: <address>
    port: <number>
    cost: <number>
    <parm>: <value>
----

The `name` identifies the transport so that it can be referenced for starting
and stopping in the console and the command line.  It is also used by auto
discovery to match transports and it is sent to other peers so that it can be
read in log files and diagnostic output.  It has no protocol implications
beyond auto discovery, a misspelling won't cause it to stop working.

[[service_and_networks]]
Services and Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The endpoint protocols: RV, NATS, Redis; all have a service defined to separate
the data flow from one another.  By using the same service name allows these
endpoints to share the same namespace.  The underlay network that connects the
namespaces can both be configured using the YAML files or the console and also
be specified by the connecting clients.  The clients can specify a network with
PGM multicast or with TCP endpoints and meshes.  All of networks specified by a
client that use TCP will still use multicast to resolve the endpoints by
service name by using the name protocol.

Networks use a device name and a protocol or a multicast address.  When a
network is not specified by a client or configuration, then the links between
services have to be configured by the YAML files and/or in the console.

Example networks and how they are interpreted.  All of these have a service
name associated with the network, which must match for namespace to
communicate.

- `eth0;239.1.2.3` -- Connect a PGM protocol to eth0 joining the multicast
  address of 239.1.2.3 for communicating with other peers.

- `eth0;tcp.listen` -- Connect a name protocol to the eth0 interface and
  advertise a TCP listen endpoint.

- `eth0;tcp.connect` -- Connect a name protocol to eth0, and advertise a TCP
  connection endpoint.  These resolve to a connection when listen endpoints
  appear with a clients that use the above.

- `eth0;mesh` -- Connect a name protocol to eth0, and advertise a TCP mesh
  endpoint.  This creates connections to all other mesh endpoints advertised.

- `eth0;any` -- Connect a name protocol to the eth0, and connect to a listen or
  a mesh advertised.

The device name eth0 can be substituted with an IPv4 address, like
`192.168.1.0;tcp.listen`, or a hostname that resolves to an IPv4 address.  If a
network is specified without a name, like `;tcp.listen`, then the machine's
hostname is used to find the device.

The configuration for the PGM, name, TCP protocols are generated as needed by
the client if they do not exist.  When a service already is configured, then
it is used instead and the network parameters are ignored.

Cost
~~~~

All of the internal transports have a cost assigned to the links.  The routing
from peer to peer uses this cost to find a path that minimizes the cost.  Equal
cost links are utilized by each peer by encoding a path into the message
header.  This path is enumerated from 0 -> 3, so there is a maximum of 4 equal
cost paths possible between any 2 peers in the network.  The per path cost can
be configured by using different cost metrics for each link.  The default cost
is 1000 so that a configured cost can be less or greater than 1000.  These
configured metrics are replicated throughout the network so that every peer
agrees the cost of every path that exists.  A case where lowering the cost is
useful is when some of the links have higher performance than others as is the
case when all peers exist within a host or within a data center.  A case when
configuring different cost for each of the 4 paths is to load balance multiple
links with equal performance.

Example of configuring a lower cost mesh on a bridge:

----
  tport: rv_7500
  type: mesh
  route:
    device: docker0
    cost: 10
----

If every container within this host has a RV client that connects with a
network and service of `-network eth0;mesh -service 7500` then the cost of 10
discovered through the `docker0` bridge.  The name protocols used will use the
name of the device as their tport name.

Example of configuring a load balanced cost for links through a data center:

----
  transports:
    - tport: a_mesh
      type: mesh
      route:
        listen: *
        connect: [ host, host2, host3, host4 ]
        port: 5000
        cost: [ 100, 1000, 1000, 1000 ]
    - tport: b_mesh
      type: mesh
      route:
        listen: *
        connect: [ host, host2, host3, host4 ]
        port: 5001
        cost: [ 1000, 100, 1000, 1000 ]
    - tport: c_mesh
      type: mesh
      route:
        listen: *
        connect: [ host, host2, host3, host4 ]
        port: 5002
        cost: [ 1000, 1000, 100, 1000 ]
    - tport: d_mesh
      type: mesh
      route:
        listen: *
        connect: [ host, host2, host3, host4 ]
        port: 5003
        cost: [ 1000, 1000, 1000, 100 ]
----

This creates 4 equal mesh networks, each of which is preferred for part of the
subject space.  The connect and cost can be enumerated as connect, connect2,
connect3, connect4 and cost, cost2, cost3, cost4 as well as an array.

TCP Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TCP type and mesh type links are encrypted using AES 128 bit in counter
mode.  The protocol above the link layer handles the authentication for
trusting the peer and the messages that are received, described in
<<authentication>>.  The encryption is set up by a ECDH exchange.  Each side
generates a ECDH keypair and sends the public key with a checksum and a 128 bit
nonce value.  Each side computes the secret key and uses the KDF to mix the
secret with the nonce value to arrive at a 128 bit key and a 128 bit counter
for sending and receiving.  Thse are used to encrypt and decrypt the other
sides bytes.

----
alice -> bob [ 8 bytes checksum ] [ 32 bytes pub key ] [ 16 bytes nonce ]
bob -> alice [ 8 bytes checksum ] [ 32 bytes pub key ] [ 16 bytes nonce ]
alice.secret = ECDH( bob public key, alice private key )
bob.secret = ECDH( alice public key, bob private key )
alice.recv key+counter = KDF( secret[32] + bob.nonce[16] ) -> 64 bytes
alice.send key+counter = KDF( secret[32] + alice.once[16] ) -> 64 bytes
bob.recv key+counter = KDF( secret[32] + alice.nonce[16] ) -> 64 bytes
bob.send key+counter = KDF( secret[32] + bob.once[16] ) -> 64 bytes
----

The 32 byte secret will be the same on both ends.  The nonce is a random 16
byte value.  The KDF function mixes into the keys a preshared salt value,
generated by ms_key_gen in a "config/.salt" file described in <<config>>.
Without this salt value, the key exchange will compute incorrect keys even
though the secret is computed correctly.

The 8 bytes checksum is a CRC of the pub key and the nonce in big endian, so
the first 4 bytes will be zero.  The zero bytes cause an encrypted connection
to an unencrypted endpoint to fail.

The 64 byte result of the KDF computation is folded with XOR to arrive at the
16 byte AES key and the 16 byte counter value.

Open PGM
~~~~~~~~

PGM is a multicast protocol, which layers reliability on the native UDP
multicast.  The parameters for it declare the amount of memory used for
buffering data and control the timers when retransmitting is necessary.

The type of PGM used is UDP encapsulated using the port specified.  The address
specification has a network, a send address, and multiple receive addresses,
formatted as `network;recv1,..;send`, so this is a valid address:
`192.168.1.0;224.4.4.4,225.5.5.5;226.6.6.6` where the send address is the last
part and the middle addresses are where packets are received.  If the network
part is unspecified, then the hostname is used to find the interface.  If there
is only one multicast address, then that is used for both sending and
receiving.

Example `tport_mypgm.yaml`:

----
  tport: mypgm
  type: pgm
  route:
    listen: 192.168.1.0;224.4.4.4
    port: 4444
    cost: 100
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field      |   Default    | Description              
| listen     | ;239.192.0.1 | Multicast address        
| connect    | ;239.192.0.1 | Multicast address        
| port       | 9000         | UDP port                 
| cost       | 1000         | Cost of PGM network
| mtu        | 16384        | Maximum UDP packet size  
| txw_sqns   | 4096         | Send window size         
| rxw_sqns   | 4096         | Receive window size      
| txw_secs   | 15           | Send window in seconds
| mcast_loop | 2            | Loop through the host    
|======================================================

The transmit and receive window sizes expand to the reliability time or the
`txw_secs` parameter.  When the `txw_secs` is not set, then the reliability
passed on the command line or as a configuration parameter is used.  The
receive window memory is not used until there is packet loss and a
retransmission occurs.  Unrecoverable packet loss occurs when the transmission
window no longer has the sequences that are lost.  The `mcast_loop`, when set
to 2, allows two peers to share the same network on the same host.  This causes
packets to loop back through the interface and allows multiple PGM networks to
coexist on the same multicast group.

In addition to the multicast networking, an inbox protocol is used for point
to point messages.  The network specified in the multicast address is used
as the inbox network, with a random port.

The listen and connect addresses act similarly, two peers using different
methods will communicate if the multicast send address matches one of the
receive addresses and the inboxes are connected.

TCP Mesh
~~~~~~~~

A TCP mesh is a group of peers which automatically maintain connections with
every other peer.  When a new peer joins the mesh, it opens a connection with
all the other peers which are currently members of the mesh.

The timeout parameter causes the connecting peer to retry for this amount of
time.  When the timeout expires, the transport will not try to connect until
told to do so again.

Multiple connect addresses are normally specified so that some connection
likely succeeds if that network is running.  Allow peers can specify multiple
connect addresses since they use both listen and connect methods to join a
network.  After one connection succeeds, all the other connections in progress
are stopped and the list of mesh members are downloaded from the peers and
those are connected.

Example `tport_mymesh.yaml`:

----
  tport: mymesh
  type: mesh
  route:
    listen: *
    connect: [ host, host2, host3, host4 ]
    port: 9000
    timeout: 0
    noencrypt: true
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field      |   Default    | Description              
| listen     | *            | Passive listener         
| connect    | localhost    | Active joiner            
| device     |              | Use peer discovery
| port       | random       | Listener or connect port 
| timeout    | 15           | Active connect timeout   
| cost       | 1000         | Cost of mesh links
| noencrypt  | false        | Disable encryption
|======================================================

If the mesh is a stable network, then the timeout set to a larger value or zero
can prevent a network split where some parts of the network are isolated for a
period of time.  When a host is restarted doesn't have as much of an effect by
a timeout since it is rejoining an existing network.  If a timeout expires,
then an admin request to rejoin the network is possible through the console.

When a `device` parameter is used, then multicast is used through the name
protocol to discover peers that are joining the same mesh, matching using the
tport name.  After discovering the peer, a connection with TCP is used to join
the mesh.  The port can be random with a device, since the address is
discovered rather than connected.  Both the device and connect can be methods
can be used.

The `noencrypt` parameter set to true disables tcp link encryption.  Both the
listener and connector must match this setting, otherwise they will close the
connection after receiving the first bytes sent.

TCP Point-to-point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TCP point to point connection to another peer.  This is useful to create
ad-hoc topologies at the network boundaries.

Example `tport_mytcp.yaml`:

----
  tport: mytcp
  type: tcp
  route:
    listen: eth0
    connect: host
    port: 9001
    timeout: 0
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field      |   Default    | Description              
| listen     | *            | Passive listener         
| connect    | localhost    | Active joiner            
| device     |              | Use peer discovery
| port       | random       | Listener or connect port 
| timeout    | 15           | Active connect timeout   
| cost       | 1000         | Cost of the TCP link
| edge       | false        | A peer at the edge       
| noencrypt  | false        | Disable encryption
|======================================================

A TCP protocol is either a listener or a connector, the appropriate config is
used at run time when a connect or listen is used to activate the port.  When
device is used to discover the peers through the multicast name protocol, the
listeners are matched with the connectors.  When more than one listener is
discovered by a connector, then connections are made to each one.

Whether a configuration is used to connect or listen is specified by a listen
or connect command or configuration.  If multiple connections are specified by
the connect parameter, then the first connection that is successful will cause
the others to stop trying to connect.

The `edge` parameter set to true causes the passive peer to pool the
connections on a single transport, similar to a multicast transport where the
traffic is primarily through a gateway peer.  The `noencrypt` parameter set to
true disables tcp link encryption.  Both the listener and connector must match
this setting, otherwise they will close the connection after receiving the
first bytes sent.

If the `listen` or `connect` parameters specify a port, as in "localhost:8000",
then that port overides the parameter `port` configured.  A device name is
resolved before the hostname DNS resolver is tried, so "eth0:8000" will resolve
the address configured on the eth0 device.

Tib RV
~~~~~~

The RV protocol supports both the RV5 and RV6+ styles of clients.  The RV6+
clients use the daemon for the inbox endpoint and don't create sessions, the
RV5 clients use a unique session for each connection and allow an inbox reply
in the subscription start.  These differences cause decades old software
incompatibilities and pressure to re-engineer legacy messaging systems.

There clients usually specify the network and service they want to connect,
which is different from the other clients.  When a client requests to connect
to a multicast network, the Rai MS `ms_server` will start a PGM transport for
it, unless an existing transport is already defined named with a `rv_` prefix
and a service numbered suffix.

When the `rv_7500` transport exists as a TCP mesh, then this network is
remapped to the predefined transport when a RV client uses the service 7500
and the multicast network specified by the client is ignored.  When no
multicast network is specified, then no Rai MS transport is created and
the existing transports are used.

Example `tport_myrv.yaml`:

----
  tport: myrv
  type: rv
  route:
    listen: *
    port: 7500
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field              |   Default    | Description              
| listen             | *            | Passive listener  
| port               | random       | Listener port     
| use_service_prefix | true         | Use a service namespace
| no_permanent       | false        | Exit if no connections
| no_mcast           | false        | Ignore multicast networking
| no_fakeip          | false        | Use IPv4 address for session
|======================================================

Unless the use_service_prefix is false, the traffic is segregated to the
`_rv_7500` where service is 7500.  If it is true, then all services that also
have use_service_prefix set to true will share the same namespace.  Without
`no_fakeip` set to true, the session and inbox values are random and not based
on the IPv4 address of the host.  This allows RV networks to work without a
routable IPv4 network across private address spaces that are common with
NATs, VMs, and/or container networks.

NATS
~~~~

NATS is a pub/sub system that is similar to RV with respect to subject schema
with some extensions for queue groups and optionally persistent message
streaming.  The protocol support does not include the streaming components,
only the pub/sub and queue groups.  NATS does not have an inbox point-to-point
publish scheme, it relies on the client to create a unique subject for this
functionality.

Example `tport_mynats.yaml`:

----
  tport: mynats
  type: nats
  route:
    listen: *
    port: 4222
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field      |   Default    | Description              
| listen     | *            | Passive listener  
| port       | random       | Listener port     
| service    | _nats        | Service namespace
| network    | none         | Join a network
|======================================================

If the network is specified, then starting the NATS service will also join
the network.  A network format is as described in <<service_and_networks>>.

Redis
~~~~~

Redis has a pub/sub component that has slightly different semantics, without a
reply subject for request/reply.  It also uses the term `channel` to refer to a
subscription.  A pattern subscription is separated by a psub operator, allowing
subscriptions and publishes to any series of bytes.

Example `tport_myredis.yaml`:

----
  tport: myredis
  type: redis
  route:
    listen: *
    port: 6379
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field      |   Default    | Description              
| listen     | *            | Passive listener  
| port       | random       | Listener port     
| service    | _redis       | Service namespace
| network    | none         | Join a network
|======================================================

The data operators that operate on cached structures like lists and sets, etc.
These commands are available when a shared memory key value segment created and
passed as a command line argument to the server (example: -m sysv:raikv.shm), or
defined as a value in the config files (example: map: "sysv:raikv.shm").

If the network is specified, then starting the Redis service will also join
the network.  A network format is as described in <<service_and_networks>>.

[[telnet]]
Telnet
~~~~~~

Telnet is a way to get a console prompt, but it doesn't start by default.  It
uses the same transport config as the pub/sub protocols.  It also can be used
by network configuration tools to install a configuration remotely.  A telnet
client signals the service that it has terminal capabilities which enables
command line editing.  

Example `tport_mytelnet.yaml`:

----
  tport: mytelnet
  type: telnet
  route:
    listen: *
    port: 22
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field      |   Default    | Description              
| listen     | *            | Passive listener  
| port       | random       | Listener port     
|======================================================

[[web]]
Web
~~~

Web handles http requests and websocket endpoints and integrates an web
application that can be used to graph activity and show internal tables.  The
web application is compiled into the server, so no external file access is
necessary.

Example `tport_myweb.yaml`:

----
  tport: myweb
  type: web
  route:
    listen: *
    port: 80
    http_dir: "./"
    http_username: myuser
    http_password: mypassword
----

[%autowidth,options="header",grid="cols",stripes="even"]
|======================================================
| Field         |   Default    | Description              
| listen        | *            | Passive listener  
| port          | random       | Listener port     
| http_dir      | none         | Serve files from this directory
| http_username | none         | Adds username to digest auth
| http_password | none         | Sets password for username
| http_realm    | none         | Sets realm for username
| htdigest      | none         | Load digest file for auth
|======================================================

If http_dir is not set, then this service does not access the filesystem
for processing http get requests.  It has a set of html pages compiled
into the binary that it uses for viewing the server state.

If http_dir is set, then the files located in the directory will override the
internal files.  The html files and websocket requests also have a templating
system which substitute values from the server.  If `@(show ports)` appears in
a html page, it is replace with a html `<table>` of ports.  If `template "res"
: @{show ports}` is sent using a websocket, it expands to a JSON array off
ports and the reply is `"res" : [ports...]`.

Any of the commands from the console interface are now exposed on the http
endpoint.  Requesting "show ports" will respond with a JSON array of transports
with the current totals of messages and bytes:

----
$ wget --http-user=myuser --http-password=mypassword -q -O - "http://localhost:80/?show ports"                                                                        
[{"tport":"rv.0", "type":"rv", "cost":1000, "fd":13, "bs":"", "br":"", "ms":"", "mr":"", "lat":"", "fl":"SLI", "address":"rv://127.0.0.1:7500"},
{"tport":"mesh4.1", "type":"mesh", "cost":1000, "fd":16, "bs":"", "br":"", "ms":"", "mr":"", "lat":"", "fl":"SLX", "address":"mesh://10.4.4.18:19500"},
{"tport":"primary.2", "type":"tcp", "cost":1000, "fd":18, "bs":29500, "br":47324, "ms":229, "mr":355, "lat":"26.5ms", "fl":"C", "address":"robotron.1@tcp://209.237.252.104:18500"},
{"tport":"secondary.3", "type":"tcp", "cost":1000, "fd":20, "bs":23276, "br":39134, "ms":181, "mr":311, "lat":"29.4ms", "fl":"C", "address":"edo.2@tcp://209.237.252.98:18500"}]
----

The websocket endpoint can also be used to subscribe subjects.  When a message
is published to the websocket, the format used is:

----
"subject" : { "field" : "value" }
----

This requires that the messages published  can be converted to JSON or is
already in JSON format.

The http_username / http_password or htdigest will cause http digest
authentication to be used and require them for access.  The above wget is used
with the example configuration.

A htdigest file contains a list of users and can be created by the htdigest
program distributed with the Apache packages.

----
$ htdigest -c .htdigest realm@raims myuser
Adding password for myuser in realm realm@raims.
New password: mypassword
Re-type new password: mypassword

$ cat .htdigest
myuser:realm@raims:56f52efe43dcf419e991ea6452ae6f06
----

Then `tport_myweb.yaml` is configured like this:

----
  tport: myweb
  type: web

Only one realm can be used by the service.  If http_realm is configured then
that realm is used, otherwise the first realm in the htdigest file is used.  If
no realm is specified but a user and password are specified, then "realm@raims"
is used.
