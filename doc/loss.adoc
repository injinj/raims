[[message_loss]]
Message Loss
------------

Under normal conditions, the sequence of the message is one greater than the
last sequence received.  The sequence numbers are 64 bits so they will never be
zero.  These conditions are possible when a sequence is not in incrementing
order from the last message received, which is what normally occurs.

- Publisher includes a time stamp

This causes the subscriber to synchronize the sequence numbers.  The publisher
will always include a time stamp when the first message of a subject is
published, or when the last sequence is old enough to be cycled from the
publisher sequence window.

- The first message received

When a subscription start occurs it will usually not contain a timestamp,
unless it is the first message published.

- The message sequence is repeated

A sequence is less than or equal the last sequence received.  This indicates
the message was already processed.  The message is dropped.

- The message sequence skips ahead

Some sequences are missing, indicating messages were lost.  Notification of
message loss is propagated to the subscriptions.

- The message subject is not subscribed

The subscription may have dropped and the pubilisher has not yet seen the
unsubscribe.

Multicast sequence numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sequence numbers include a time frame when the publisher starts the
message stream.  This is the computation that creates a new sequence stream.

This truncates nanosecond timestamp to approximately 10 second intervals, a new
time frame can only occur after 10 seconds.  The time frame is stored in the
upper 29 bits will be valid until the year 2115.  The sequence resolution
within a time frame is 35 bits or 34 billion sequences.  These are rotated to
new time frames when the sequence number is zero.

These are properties of the time frame encoded in the message sequence numbers:

1.  A start of a new multicast stream sequence will use the current time, this
is always after the last convergence time stamp.  The current time is also used
as needed when memory limitations prevent caching of the last sequence
published.  When the sequence is cached, the additional messages won't change
the time frame but will increment the sequence number.

2.  A new subscription start or uncached sequence publish can verify that the
first message received is greater than the network convergence time.  This is
used to validate that the message stream is uninterrupted to the start of the
time frame, since message loss has not occurred since the before network
convergence.

All of the transports are stream oriented, so a loss of unrecoverable network
packets will cause connections to drop and a new convergence state by pruning
the lost routes.  All peers will agree on a time that convergence is reached.
New time frames are created for all messages published so that the time frame
constructed in any one peer greater than the convergence time in all peers.

When routes are added to or subtracted from the network, the message routing is
not stable until all peers have finished adjusting their view of the network.
The peer that publishes a message may use a sub-optimal forwarding path to the
recipients until they are notified that better paths are available with link
state exchanges.

Publish sequence window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A map of subject to sequence numbers for published multicast messages is
maintained by each peer.  This map rotates when a configured memory limit is
reached, `pub-window-size`, and the window time interval is greater than a
configured time, `pub-window-time`, which must be at least 10 seconds.  When a
subject is rotated out of the window, the sequence number is restarted with a
new time frame.

Subscription sequence window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A map of subject to sequence numbers for the subscriptions that a peer has
is also maintained.  This validates that the messages are processed in order
and allows notification of message loss when the sequences skip and does not
allow a message to be processed twice.  The memory limit for this is
`sub-window-size` and time limit is `sub-window-time`.  When a subject is
rotated out of the window, then the publisher did not update for the window
time and the next sequence is treated as if a new subscription was created.

Message duplicates are avoided by discarding messages that are older than the
trailing edge of the subscription sequence window.  The clock skew between
systems is estimated.  The console command `show skew` will display the
calculated clock skew between systems.

----

The pong calculation subtracts the round trip time and is the most accurate,
the others disregard the latency of the network.  The hb are from time
differences of directly attached peers using heartbeats and are shared with
those not directly attached.  The ref is the peer (0 = self, 1 = A.1) that
originated the hb difference.  The time is the estimated clock setting of the
remote peer in the current timezone.

Configuration for sequence windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sizes and windows are in the parameters section of the config file and
default to 4 megabyte (about 60,000 subjects for publishers and 20,000 for
subscribers) and 10 seconds.  The size of the windows will have an overhead of
48 bytes for publishers and 128 bytes for subscribers in addition to the
subject size.  The 10 second rotate timer could cause more memory to be used if
lots of new subjects are published or lots of new subjects are subscribed
within 10 seconds.

----
$ cat config/param.yaml
parameters:
  pub-window-size: 10 mb
  pub-window-time: 60 sec
  sub-window-size: 10 mb
  sub-window-time: 60 sec

The `show loss` console command displays the messaging statistics for the
peers.

- repeat -- count of multicast messages received more than one time
- rep time -- last time of repeated messages
- not sub -- count of multicast messages received which were not subscribed
- not time -- last time of not subscribed
- msg loss -- number of multicast messages which were lost
- loss time -- last time of multicast message loss
- ibx loss -- number of messages which were lost from the inbox stream
- ibx time -- last time of inbox message loss

An inbox message loss is not unusual since the point to point messages are
often used for link state exchanges and other network convergence functions.
Inbox message loss is usually not as problematic as multicast message loss
since there often timers are retries associated with their usage.

Multicast message loss is much more difficult to recover from, since there
are usually many multicast streams and tracking the state of each one is
a problem solved by persistent message queues.  This requires clients
which track the state of the messages they consume and notify the queue when
they are finished with processing them.

Notification of message loss
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a message arrives with a sequence which is not in order, it is forwarded
with state indicating how many messages are missing, if that can be determined.
The protocol handling of this notification is to publish a message indicating
how many messages were lost.

RV protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^

The RV protocol publishes a message to the 
`_RV.ERROR.SYSTEM.DATALOSS.INBOUND.BCAST` subject with a count of lost messages.
These are throttled so that on one is published per second after the first one
is published.

Example:

----
   mtype : "A"
     sub : _RV.ERROR.SYSTEM.DATALOSS.INBOUND.BCAST
    data : {
   ADV_CLASS : "ERROR"
  ADV_SOURCE : "SYSTEM"
    ADV_NAME : "DATALOSS.INBOUND.BCAST"
    ADV_DESC : "lost msgs"
        lost : 7
     sub_cnt : 7
        sub1 : "RSF.REC.PAC.NaE"
       lost1 : 1
        sub2 : "RSF.REC.MTC.NaE"
       lost2 : 1
        sub3 : "RSF.REC.MCD.NaE"
       lost3 : 1
        sub4 : "RSF.REC.MCD.N"
       lost4 : 1
        sub5 : "RSF.REC.SPM4.NaE"
       lost5 : 1
        sub6 : "RSF.REC.MER.NaE"
       lost6 : 1
        sub7 : "RSF.REC.MER.N"
       lost7 : 1
        scid : 7500
  }
